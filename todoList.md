To-Do List Java Project (Updated)
In this updated version of the To-Do List Java project, I have made several improvements to simplify and streamline the code:

Changes Made:

Replaced switch Statements with if-else:
The switch statements used for handling task operations (like adding, removing, or updating tasks) have been replaced with if-else statements.
This change simplifies the logic and allows for more flexible conditions.

Simplified Imports:
Removed all specific import statements and replaced them with a single wildcard (*) import. 
This reduces the number of lines in the code and makes it easier to manage dependencies, especially if multiple classes from the same package are used.

Benefits of the Changes:
Improved Readability: The use of if-else statements makes the code flow easier to follow, especially for beginners.
Efficient Imports: Using wildcard imports (*) helps minimize clutter in the import section, making the code cleaner.
